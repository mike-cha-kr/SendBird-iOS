## Introduction

[Sendbird](https://sendbird.com) provides the chat API and SDK for your app, enabling real-time communication among the users. Here are various samples built using Sendbird Chat SDK.

- [Chat Swift sample](#chat-swift-sample) has core chat features. Group channel and open channel are the two main channel types in which you can create various subtypes where users can send and receive messages. This sample is written in Swift with [Sendbird Chat SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-ios-framework).

- [Chat Objective-C sample](#chat-objective-c-sample) has core chat features. Group channel and open channel are the two main channel types in which you can create various subtypes where users can send and receive messages. This sample is written in Objective-C with [Sendbird Chat SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-ios-framework).

- [UIKit Swift sample](#uikit-sample-swift-only) is a user interface development kit that allows easy and fast integration of core chat features for new or pre-existing client apps. UI components can be fully customized with ease to expedite the roll-out of your client appâ€™s in-app chat service. This sample is written in Swift with [Sendbird UIKit](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-uikit-ios) and [Sendbird Chat SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-ios-framework). Find more about Sendbird UIKit on [Sendbird UIKit document](https://sendbird.com/docs/uikit/v1/ios/getting-started/about-uikit).

- [SyncManager Swift sample](#syncmanager-sample-swift-only) is equipped with a local cache along with core chat features. For faster data loading and caching, the sample synchronizes with the Sendbird server and saves a list of group channels and the messages within the local cache into your client app. This sample is written in Swift with [Sendbird SyncManager SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-syncmanager-ios) and [Sendbird Chat SDK](https://github.com/sendbird/sendbird-ios-framework). Find more about SyncManager on [Sendbird SyncManager document](https://sendbird.com/docs/syncmanager/v1/ios/getting-started/about-syncmanager).
